# <p style="text-align:center;"> 🌳 Agronomic Characteristics Extraction and Prediction from Agrocam Vineyard Images 🌳 </p>

## 📘 Context

This project is the result of my end-of-year internship which consist in **extracting agronomic characteristics of vineyard images** taken with an open-source and low-cost camera system (named Agrocam) and **predicting them for a 15 day period**.

The extraction and prediction have been done on **images taken by an [Agrocam](https://agrocam.agrotic.org)**. We focused on camera installed on three type of vineyard :
- **[TVITI](https://agrocam.agrotic.org/data/79bt3wkh/)** => Plot managed sustainably by the winegrower and without ground cover
- **[AVITI](https://agrocam.agrotic.org/data/7s3a5abm/)** => Plot with an interrow vegetal cover composed of green fertilizer (sow by the winegrower)
- **[DVITI](https://agrocam.agrotic.org/data/4j7g2wk9/)** => Plot with an interrow vegetal cover composed of spontaneous vegetation (with no human intervention)

The **agronomic characteristics** extracted from the images and forecasted for 15 days are : 
- Canopy height
- Canopy porosity
- Leaf hue
- Inter-row hue.

## ⚙️ Pipeline Overview

This pipeline aims at **extracting and predicting agronomic parameters from vineyard images in real condition**. For that, it has been seperated into 4 main steps :
- **Segmentation** of vineyard images into semantic zones (leaves, trunk, inter-row, irrigation sheath)
- **Extraction** of agronomics characteristics using those semantic zones
- **Selection** of those characteristics so that it's coherent with scientific knowledge
- **Prediction** of characteristics using temporal series of those vineyard images

## 🔎 Repository Organization

This pipeline is composed of 1 common block (*Core*) 4 *almost* self-sufficient block (*Segmentation*, *Extraction*, *Selection* and *Prediction*) :

| Folder | Content |
|:-:|:-:|
| [Core](https://github.com/nicolasgeffroy/agrocam_agro_chara/Core) | Contains an **example of an image database and intermediate results** which can be directly used by pipeline blocks. It is also where **output of each blocks as stored**. |
| [Format](https://github.com/nicolasgeffroy/agrocam_agro_chara/Format) | Contains all the functions which goal is to **determine the best image format to use for its [Segmentation](https://github.com/nicolasgeffroy/agrocam_agro_chara/Segmentation)** |
| [Segmentation](https://github.com/nicolasgeffroy/agrocam_agro_chara/Segmentation) | Contains all the function to summarize the **images into a dataset**, use them to **train a model (MobileNetv3 or DeepLabv3) for segmentation** and use this trained model. It also contains the function used to **determine the image format used for learning**. |
